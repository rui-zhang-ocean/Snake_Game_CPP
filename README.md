## Discussions and future steps

* As C++ is an object oriented language, it would be better to create a class that contains some global functions as member functions, which takes care of gameplay.
* Remove screen flickering caused by `system("cls")`.
* Add 'Game Over' logo before restarting the start screen.
* It'd be interesting to apply machine learning algorithms to automatically play this game to get an optimal ending (snake fullfilled the screen!)
